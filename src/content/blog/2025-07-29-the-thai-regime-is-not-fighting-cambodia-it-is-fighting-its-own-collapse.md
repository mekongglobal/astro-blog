# THE THAI REGIME IS NOT FIGHTING CAMBODIA. IT IS FIGHTING ITS OWN COLLAPSE

Thailand is not afraid of losing to Cambodia. It is afraid of losing control over its own people.

*   That is the truth behind every bomb dropped and every lie broadcasted.
    
*   This is not a battle between two countries.
    
*   This is a desperate regime trying to survive the storm it created.
    

At the Malaysia peace talks, the Thai delegation arrived stiff, divided, and visibly strained.

*   Their acting Prime Minister spoke about restraint. Their Foreign Minister scribbled notes.
    
*   Their Army Chief sat silent with his arms folded and eyes fixed downward.
    

> They came with rehearsed words but fractured posture.

## While Cambodia presented documents, timelines, and readiness to de-escalate through verifiable channels.

*   Thailand rejected third-party observers.
    
*   They refused to discuss international legal routes.
    
*   They insisted on verifying peace through their own military command, the same military that was still firing into Cambodian provinces while the peace talks were underway.
    

> This is their game.
> 
> Say peace in front of cameras.
> 
> Keep the guns active behind them.

## The Thai regime is not negotiating to end conflict.

It is using the meeting to stall time, reposition assets, and rewrite public narrative. They hope that if they say the word “peace” often enough, people will stop noticing the damage beneath their feet. They believe confusion is control. But that illusion is breaking.

## The world is watching a government whose voice says diplomacy while its hands drop war crimes.

*   The evidence is visible.
    
*   The F-16 strikes have been geolocated.
    
*   The cluster munitions are documented by international observers and confirmed by Human Rights Watch. And yet their military continues to parade false claims, painting Cambodia as the threat to Thai sovereignty. But sovereignty is not defended through deception.
    

> It is not protected through censorship and silence. It is not earned through bloodshed on someone else’s soil.

## Inside Thailand, citizens are no longer rallying behind the state.

*   They are whispering questions.
    
*   Why is our economy collapsing?
    
*   Why is our baht falling deeper every day?
    
*   Why is tourism drying up within days of this conflict?
    
*   Why are we being told we are defending the nation, when even our own civilians are unprotected?
    
*   Why are journalists blocked from asking real questions?
    
*   Why are ministers vanishing from public visibility?
    

> Because the regime cannot afford truth.
> 
> It has no answer for the military’s insubordination.
> 
> It cannot explain why it silenced the media.
> 
> It cannot justify why international courts are avoided.
> 
> And it cannot allow the war to end without facing the fury of its own people.

Their generals fear humiliation more than combat. Their ministers fear exposure more than instability. Their monarchy fears irrelevance more than war.

> That is why they cannot de-escalate.
> 
> Stopping now would mean admitting that the conflict was never about Cambodia.
> 
> It was about hiding internal fracture with external fire.
> 
> It was about masking political decay with nationalism.
> 
> It was about keeping the illusion of control.

> But the illusion is fading.
> 
> At the peace table, the world saw who came ready.
> 
> Cambodia came prepared, consistent, and law-aligned.
> 
> Thailand came with pretexts, hesitation, and visible internal contradictions.
> 
> While Cambodia asked for international mediation and documented protocols,
> 
> Thailand demanded to handle everything alone.
> 
> Because international law exposes what they cannot contain.

> Their military continues to operate without transparency.
> 
> Their economic indicators are falling.
> 
> Their civilian leadership is politically cornered.
> 
> And their digital spaces are now silenced under fear of martial backlash.

This is not a sovereign defense. It is a performance collapsing under its own weight. Even the smartest citizens inside Thailand dare not speak because their laws protect institutions more than people.

*   Their online spaces are muted.
    
*   Their voices are monitored.
    
*   Their dissent is criminalized.
    

## Thailand continues to scream that Cambodia is the aggressor, but the world is no longer listening to the slogans. It is watching the hands.

1.  The planes.
    
2.  The bombs.
    
3.  The coverups.
    
4.  The contradictions.
    

Thailand is now trapped in its own strategy. It cannot stop attacking, not because it wants to win, but because it cannot afford to lose face. Even peace now would cost them everything.

1.  It would reveal the absence of real control.
    
2.  It would expose the disconnection between government and army.
    
3.  It would force the public to ask why this war happened at all.
    

## Cambodia is not responding with fire.

> We are responding with law.
> 
> We are responding with restraint.
> 
> We are responding with documented truth.
> 
> This is not about aggression.
> 
> This is about exposure.
> 
> And Thailand has exposed itself.

The more they attack, the faster their currency falls. The more they shout, the more their mask slips. The more they deny, the clearer their intentions become. This is not Cambodia destabilizing Thailand.

> This is Thailand unraveling in front of the world.
> 
> And everyone sees it now.

## ASEAN may not speak directly, But they have chosen who they sit beside. The world may not rush to take sides. But it knows who is avoiding courts.

> And history may take its time,
> 
> but it never forgets who ran from the law and who stood in it.

## Cambodia will not provoke.

## Cambodia will not retreat.

## Cambodia will not abandon truth.

> Thailand may keep its weapons in the sky. But its mask is already falling to the ground.
