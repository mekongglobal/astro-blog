# Who Really Started the War, and Who Wants Peace?

If we are being reasonable, letâ€™s look at the facts: the timeline of events, the economic and military realities, and the sheer imbalance between our nations. Cambodia â€” a small country still healing from genocide, civil war, and decades of pain â€” has no interest in starting a war.

## The Timeline of Aggression

*   **28 May 2025 --** A Cambodian soldier was killed by the Thai army inside our territory at Preah Vihear. In response, Cambodia took the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Thailand refused to participate.
    

If Thailand truly wanted peace, why avoid international arbitration? Following this incident â€” instead of de-escalating, Thailand threatened Cambodia:

*   Cutting off electricity and fuel supplies.
    
*   Shutting down internet connections.
    
*   Closing the borders.
    

> _These were not the actions of a nation seeking peace._

*   **16 July 2025** â€” Three Thai soldiers were injured by landmines. Instead of cooperating to address this humanitarian issue, Thailand used the incident to accuse Cambodia.
    
*   **23 July 2025** â€” Five more Thai soldiers were injured by these same old landmines. On the very same day, Thailand escalated tensions by expelling the Cambodian ambassador â€” a direct attack on diplomatic relations.
    
*   **24 July 2025 â€”** Thailand took this conflict to a new level with a large-scale military escalation:
    
    *   Violating bilateral agreements by illegally entering Ta Muen Thom Temple. Installing barbed wire and flying surveillance drones in Cambodian territory.
        
    *   Opening fire on Cambodian troops.
        
    *   Escalating from light weapons to heavy artillery.
        
    *   Even deploying fighter jets, expanding the conflict to Ta Krabei Temple, Phnom Kmoach, and Mom Bei in Preah Vihear province.
        

> The ASEAN Chairâ€™s Attempt at Peace:
> 
> That same evening, 24 July, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, in his capacity as ASEAN Chair, held urgent calls with the Cambodian Prime Minister and Thailandâ€™s acting Prime Minister.

# **He urged an immediate ceasefire.**

*   Cambodia agreed immediately â€” because we did not start this fight.
    
*   Anwar Ibrahim reported that Thailand initially agreed to the ceasefire at midnight. But just over an hour later, they reversed their position and delayed the ceasefire. The ASEAN Chair is fully aware of this sequence of events.
    

# The Reality After the Talks

But what happened after these calls for peace?

*   **In the early hours of 25 July (around 2:00 AM**) â€” instead of honoring their promise, Thailand launched heavy artillery attacks on Cambodian territory in the Eagle Field area of Preah Vihear.
    
*   **By 2:30 AM**, they expanded their attacks to Tathav, Phnom 333, and Phnom Khmoach, even deploying drones to escalate the assault.
    

> **This is not the first time. Not the second. Not even the third. Thailand keeps violating peace efforts â€” even after international intervention.**

# What Choice Do We Have? So I ask: What does Thailand expect Cambodia to do?

When our soldiers are attacked, when our territory is violated, when agreements are broken â€” what choice do we have besides defending our homeland? Why provoke us? What is the purpose of this aggression?

<p style="text-align: center">To the world: please, hear our side. Please, share our truth. We are a small nation fighting only to protect our home. Cambodia wants peace. <img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t8e/2/16/1f1f0_1f1ed.png" alt="ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­" class="xz74otr x15mokao x1ga7v0g x16uus16 xbiv7yw" style="border: 0px; border-radius: 0px; object-fit: fill;" width="16" height="16"></p>
