# Dear people of Thailand,

To the millions suffering under failed leadership and a deepening economic crisis — it is time to stand for justice and fight for the future of your next generation.

You know better than anyone that your leaders are power-hungry gamblers, running from your nation’s real problems instead of solving them.

Right now, your soldiers should be rescuing Thai families from devastating floods — not being pushed to kill innocent people and invade your neighbors.

Meanwhile, the economy is falling apart. Thailand’s tourism — the backbone of your economy — is collapsing.

**From January 1 to July 5, 2025,** Thailand welcomed 16.8 million international tourists, a **5%** decrease compared to last year.

Visitors from nearby markets — which make up **67.1%** of total arrivals — have dropped by **12.2%**.

Most alarming is the sharp decline in Chinese tourists — a 24.81% decrease compared to last year. Before the pandemic in 2019, China brought 11.1 million visitors (28% of all tourists). Today, Chinese tourists make up only 13.58% of arrivals.

If this trend continues, Thailand will see just 4–5 million Chinese visitors in 2025 — the lowest in 12 years (excluding Covid).

This isn’t just about numbers. It’s about survival:

Chinese tourists spend an average of 42,428 baht per trip and stay 7.36 days, while Malaysian tourists (who have now overtaken China as the top source market) spend only 21,450 baht and stay just 4.17 days.

Even though long-haul markets like the US, UK, and Australia are growing, they only make up 28% of arrivals, which cannot fully offset the loss of high-spending Chinese travelers.

This is a national crisis. Tourism revenues are plummeting, tariffs are rising, and your leaders have no plan.

Thailand war against Cambodia is not the solution, but it add up more problems to your nation. It needs real solutions — to rebuild its economy, restore safety, and bring back the tourists who once powered your nation.

It is time to rise.  
To demand an end to this senseless conflict.  
To tell your leaders to fix your nation instead of destroying others.

Your voice matters, Thai friends. History is written by those who dare to speak.
