In these 5 days, Cambodia has endured an unthinkable tragedy. The Thai military has bombed our sacred ground, a world heritage site, a piece of humanity’s shared history, painstakingly built by our ancestors centuries ago.

This is more than just rubble. It is the erasure of culture, the silencing of history, and the trampling of international law.

And yet, the world watches in silence. Where is the UN? Where are the voices that claim to defend justice and protect heritage? Silence in the face of such destruction is not neutrality, it is complicity.

We call on every international body, every journalist, and every citizen of the world: do not let this violation go unanswered. Cambodia’s pain today is a warning to us all, when heritage is destroyed, humanity loses a part of itself.
